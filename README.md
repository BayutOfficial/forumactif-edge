# Forumactif Edge

What is "Forumactif Edge" ? Forumactif Edge ( or FA Edge, FAE ) is a new modern and responsive forum theme for [Forumotion](http://www.forumotion.com/) forums, that is like an entirely new forum version in itself. It comes ready with numerous plugins such as the ability to dynamically change the forum theme. Best of all it's responsive, so you can browse on your mobile device without any problems !

You should know that this project is not officially affiliated with Forumactif. This forum version is managed by the community, so it will constantly evolve based on **your** feedback.

## FAQ

**Q : Is the installation safe ? Does it collect any data ?**

**A :** Yes, there's nothing to worry about ! Forumactif Edge collects no data during or after the installation. We're completely transparent, if you have any doubts feel free to review our source code !

**Q : Why isn't Forumactif Edge in my language ?**

**A :** I don't know every language since I'm only one person, as such I allow members of Forumactif Edge to submit translations. If a translation is not available for your language please [click here](https://github.com/SethClydesdale/forumactif-edge/wiki/Translating) to learn how to submit one.

**Q : Is this theme REALLY free ?**

**A :** Yes ! Ever since I helped design the new theme for Forumotion's support forums people have asked for it, **constantly**. Because of this, I decided that I'd design a forum version that was modern just like the support forums, so everyone could have an alternative without feeling left behind !
