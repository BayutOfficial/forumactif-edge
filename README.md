# Forumactif Edge

What is "Forumactif Edge" ? Forumactif Edge ( or FA Edge, FAE ) is a new modern and responsive forum theme for [Forumotion](http://www.forumotion.com/) forums, that is like an entirely new forum version in itself. It comes ready with numerous plugins, including a theme switcher that allows you to change the color of the theme to the one you prefer, and a control panel that helps you with installation, uninstallation, and even updates ! Plus thanks to the theme's responsiveness you'll be able to browse your forum on your mobile device without any problems.

Unlike the default versions provided by Forumotion, FAE is open source and managed by the community, so it will be constantly improving based on user feedback. This project is not officially a part of Forumactif ( Forumotion, E-toxic.. ), I have been wanting a new look for Forumotion forums for awhile, so I took it upon myself to create just that, for the entire community.
